# Café Product Suggestion System

## Problem Statement

A local café wants to build a simple suggestion system that responds to customer requests based on the products available in the café.  
The system should confirm the order if the requested item is available and politely decline if it is not.

## Available Products

- coffee  
- tea  
- juice  

## Task

- Take a single input representing the product requested by the user.
- If the user asks for **coffee**, **tea**, or **juice**, the system should confirm the order.
- If the user asks for any other item, the system should respond with:  
  **"Sorry, we don't have that item."**

## Input Format

- A single string representing the product name  
  (e.g., `coffee`, `tea`, `juice`)

## Output Format

- Display a confirmation message for available products
- Display an apology message for unavailable products
